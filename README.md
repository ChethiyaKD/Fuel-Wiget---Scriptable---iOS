# DEPRECATED

# Fuel-Wiget-Scriptable-iOS
This iOS Widget was made with Scriptable iOS app. This was able to fetch data from the API of the government website which was provided to check the fuel availability of the nearest fuel station. However the API went offline before the widget could perform at it's best.
